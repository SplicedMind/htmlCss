					<h2>Experience At Andela Bootcamp (Day 4)</h2>
					<p>Today marks the end of the home session and its series of assignments. Energy and vigor no longer at their peak as the past few days have been very eventful so much so there is little time for rest. Today is not the day I rest, its the day I consolidate on the works of days past by making sure I surmount the challenges it presents.</p>
					<p>The assignments for the day looked pretty simple at first sight, maybe simpler than the ones have been coming across so far; that’s a relieve, am going to have an easy day or so I thought. Attempting the question proofed otherwise coupled with the feedback I got from my bootcamp facilitator assistant (BFA) concerning the works have done previously. Now I have to fight a battle on two fronts, deal with the challenges of today and the errors of yesterday.
					</p>
					<p>A friend: a fellow bootcamper, asked if he could come over so we can share ideas as we are both new to the programming language and environments (software to write the codes and test it) we’ve been using so far. I was glad to have someone to share ideas with, I needed the technical and moral support.
					</p>
					<p>At the end of the day, with the help of my on site friend, those on slack and my bootcamp facilitator assistant (BFA), I was able to achieve a lot and successfully dealt with every challenge the day posed; at least, until my BFA points out my errors.</p>
